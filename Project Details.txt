AIRATTIX (STASHLY) - FINAL VIVA PROJECT BRIEF (MERN)
====================================================

1) PROJECT OVERVIEW
Airattix is a MERN-stack platform for renting Storage and Parking spaces.
It connects space owners (hosts) with users who need secure and affordable space.

Core modules:
- User authentication and profile management
- Listing creation and management (Storage/Parking)
- Booking creation and tracking
- Role-based control for User / Host / Admin


2) MERN STACK USED
MongoDB:
- Database for Users, Listings, and Bookings
- Managed with Mongoose schemas and validations

Express.js + Node.js:
- REST APIs for auth, listings, and bookings
- Middleware for JWT auth, role checks, validation, and rate limiting

React.js (Frontend Rebuild):
- React application in `frontend-react/`
- Routing handled with React Router
- API calls handled with Axios
- Reusable component-based UI structure


3) SYSTEM FLOW (ARCHITECTURE)
React Frontend  ->  Express/Node API  ->  MongoDB

Important folders:
- `backend/` (main API server)
- `frontend-react/` (React frontend)
- `src/backend/` (additional backend module structure)


4) BACKEND DETAILS
Main server: `backend/server.js`
- Connects database
- Loads middleware
- Registers routes

Key routes:
- `backend/routes/userRoutes.js`
  - Register, Login, Profile, Password Change, Forgot Password
- `backend/routes/listingRoutes.js`
  - CRUD for listings with filters and ownership/admin checks
- `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js`
  - Booking creation, validation, availability checks, booking management

Security:
- `backend/middleware/auth.js`
  - JWT token authentication
  - Role-based authorization


5) DATABASE MODELS
- `User.js`
  - User account fields, role, profile, encrypted password, login-attempt handling
- `Listing.js`
  - Unified model for parking/storage listings with price, amenities, status
- `Booking.js`
  - Booking details, type-wise fields, start/end date, status, payment status

- `Pages/ParkingPage.jsx`
- `Pages/Booking.jsx`
- `Pages/Login.jsx`
- `Pages/Register.jsx`


7) KEY FEATURES TO TELL IN VIVA

- Express-validator based API input validation
- Rate limiting for sensitive endpoints
- Booking overlap/conflict handling
- Listing verification workflow


8) IMPORTANT API ENDPOINTS
